# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If there is something terribly wrong, report vulnerabilities in the [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/LeoDog896/scannable/security/advisories) system.

Any input that causes DoS or code execution is considered a vulnerability. Input that throws an error is not a vulnerability, and should rather
be reported as an issue.
